# Heart_Disease_Prediction
In this project, diagnose that a person is cardiac patient or not on the basis of certain symptoms. The dataset consists of sveral independent variables and 
one dependent variable i.e. Outcome.
As our Outcome is in Categorical form which tells person is cardiac patient or not. So, applied the Supervised Classification model.
Then train our dataset. Then check the model score by using Evaluation matrics like accuracy and F1_score(Harmonic mean of precision and recall)in the case of classification.
After saving our model. Load it and take input from user predict wheather a patient has cardiac issue or not on that input from the saved model.
